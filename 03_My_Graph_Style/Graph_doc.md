#Â Developing two charts:

My first chart will be the correlation between recycling and income.
I'm using the data from the algorithm's class, because it looks like a nice
scatter plot data zu experiment with. (And because my scraping exercise
is not yet ready, which I will also be making my pitch is not yet ready).

- I wanted it to be as simple as possible. With the least amount of
stuff on it. I also want to draw the correlation coifficient on the
graph. I managed it. However, with code I don't understand. This is where
I got the code [from](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/regression.html).

- What I do understand and what I'll be using a lot in future is the font
change. I used the link provided by Soma [here](http://jonathansoma.com/lede/data-studio/matplotlib/changing-fonts-in-matplotlib/).
And combined it with [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21321670/how-to-change-fonts-in-matplotlib-python).

- I removed ticks. Wanted the grid however. But that is not visible on the PDF f
or some reason.

- I can adopt font styles in Pandas. But only for the texts I add. Not for the columns names, or labels. How can
I do this?
